# Combination-Android-malware-detectors 

In this repository, we host the datasets used to evaluate our EMSE paper "Assessing the opportunity of combining state-of-the-art Android malware detectors".
The files contain the lists of hashes and the labels of the apps used in our experiments. The files are saved using python pickle library: https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html
To read a file, please use: 
```python
import pickle
>>> with open(name_of_file, 'rb') as f:
...   my_list = pickle.load(f)
``` 

If you use this dataset, please consider citing our paper:
